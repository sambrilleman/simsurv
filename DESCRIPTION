Description: Simulate survival times from standard parametric survival
    distributions (exponential, Weibull, Gompertz), 2-component mixture
    distributions, or a user-defined hazard, log hazard, cumulative hazard,
    or log cumulative hazard function. Baseline covariates can be included
    under a proportional hazards assumption.
    Time dependent effects (i.e. non-proportional hazards) can be included by
    interacting covariates with linear time or a user-defined function of time.
    Clustered event times are also accommodated.
    The 2-component mixture distributions can allow for a variety of flexible
    baseline hazard functions reflecting those seen in practice.
    If the user wishes to provide a user-defined
    hazard or log hazard function then this is possible, and the resulting
    cumulative hazard function does not need to have a closed-form solution.
